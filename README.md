Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe!
-----------------------

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This simple console-based game allows you to play against a computer opponent.
The classic Tic-Tac-Toe rules apply, where the goal is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Game Rules:
    The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
    You are the 'O' player, and the computer is the 'X' player.
    Players take turns making moves by choosing an empty cell on the board.
    The game ends when either a player gets three in a row or the board is full (resulting in a tie).
